# asset-manager
Library to combine and mangle your assets and version them.
For now only JavaScript is supported.

### Usage

You can use the assetManager class out of the box, or register the Twig Extension to your twig environment.
Notably you can use the 'manglejs'/'endmanglejs' tags to encapsulate inline javascript in your template to mangle and minify them
